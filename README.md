## üìñ About The Project

This project was built to create a fun, personalized music quiz experience. Instead of random songs, it connects securely to your Spotify account, pulls your library of liked songs, and challenges you to identify 15-second snippets. The faster you answer, the more points you get!

Because it's built without a backend and uses the Spotify Web Playback SDK, the entire experience, including audio playback, happens seamlessly within your web browser.
