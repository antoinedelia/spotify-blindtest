# React + Vite Project

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App and has been migrated to use Vite.
It provides a fast and lean development experience for modern web projects.


## Getting Started
    
First, install the project dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then, you can run one of the available scripts.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open the URL printed in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.
The server uses Hot Module Replacement (HMR), so the page will provide instant updates as you make changes to your code.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes for long-term caching.
Your app is ready to be deployed from the `build` directory.

### `npm run preview`

This command runs a local static web server that serves the files from your production build directory (`build`).
It's a useful way to check if your production build works correctly on your local machine before deploying.
